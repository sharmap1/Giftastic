# Giftastic Animal Love
## Overview

This is a front end app that uses GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates gifs of user choice.JSON and jQuery logic has been used along with AJAX and GIPHY API.This app has valid HTML and stylish CSS.
When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

## Instructions
* In this app, the user can add the button of favourite animal by writing name of animal on text area. 
* When clicked on add animal button, the animal name button will be added to the screen .
* The user can display 10 still giphy images by clicking on the animal button just added on the screen. 
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.
* This is a lot of fun and excitement!!! So lets get started and click the link below:
